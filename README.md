# Real-time PBR Learning Engine

## About
This project is purely for learning purposes where I create a physically based real-time renderer and get more familiar with C++ in a graphics context.

I previously wrote a [traditional forward renderer](https://github.com/brkho/3d-engine-rust) with some bells and whistles (and a lightweight entity-component-system on top) in Rust, but I'd like to start from scratch to see what this PBR hype is all about.

## Dependencies
This project depends on a few external libraries:
- OpenGL 3.0+
- glfw
- assimp
- glad
- glm
- stb
